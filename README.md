# WordVectors
This workshop, "Word Vectors and Text Analysis," introduces the Women Writers Vector Toolkit, an interface that allows researchers to conduct word vector analysis on texts already available in the Women Writers Project (works authored by women from 1400 to 1850, https://wwp.northeastern.edu/lab/wwvt). 

Embedding models are a type of text analysis used to explore larger thematic questions about extensive collections of texts. Through this method, computational tools display spatial analogies, thus representing relationships between words.

Caterina Agostini led and taught this workshop at the Rutgers Digital Humanities Initiative and Lab (29 April 2020).
